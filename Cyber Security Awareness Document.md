# Cybersecurity Awareness Document

## 1. Cyber Awareness Basics

### 1.1 Threat Landscape
- Phishing attacks: Deceptive attempts to obtain sensitive information
  - Example: Emails impersonating your bank asking for login credentials
- Malware infections: Software designed to disrupt, damage, or gain unauthorized access
  - Types: Viruses, trojans, ransomware, spyware
- Social engineering: Psychological manipulation to trick users into making security mistakes
  - Example: Impersonating IT support to gain system access
- Data breaches: Unauthorized access to sensitive, protected, or confidential data
  - Impact: Financial loss, reputation damage, legal consequences

### 1.2 Common Attack Vectors
- Email attachments: May contain malware or malicious scripts
  - Tip: Never open attachments from unknown senders
- Unsecured Wi-Fi networks: Can allow attackers to intercept data
  - Risk: Man-in-the-middle attacks on public Wi-Fi
- Outdated software: Often contains known vulnerabilities
  - Example: WannaCry ransomware exploiting outdated Windows systems
- Weak passwords: Easy to guess or crack through brute-force attacks
  - Risk: Unauthorized access to multiple accounts if passwords are reused

## 2. Account Security

### 2.1 Signs Your Account May Be Compromised
- Unexpected password changes: Unable to log in with your usual password
- Unrecognized account activity: Strange posts, messages, or transactions
- Unusual sent emails: Messages in your sent folder that you didn't write
- Locked out of your account: Repeated failed login attempts
- Security alerts: Notifications about logins from unfamiliar locations or devices

### 2.2 Steps to Take if You Suspect a Hack
1. Change your password immediately
   - Use a strong, unique password (see section 3)
2. Enable two-factor authentication (2FA)
   - Options: SMS, authenticator apps, hardware tokens
3. Check account activity and settings
   - Review login history, connected apps, and recovery information
4. Scan your device for malware
   - Use reputable antivirus software and perform a full system scan
5. Notify relevant parties
   - Contact your bank, employer, or service provider as necessary
6. Monitor your accounts for suspicious activity
   - Set up alerts for login attempts and transactions

## 3. Password Best Practices

### 3.1 Choosing a Strong Password
- Use at least 12 characters
- Combine uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols
- Avoid personal information or common words
- Don't use sequential numbers or letters (e.g., "abc123")
- Avoid common substitutions (e.g., "@" for "a" or "1" for "i")

### 3.2 Passphrases: A Better Alternative
- Longer and more secure than traditional passwords
- Easier to remember
- Example: "correct horse battery staple" (Don't use this exact phrase)
- Tips for creating strong passphrases:
  1. Use 4-5 random words
  2. Include uncommon words or purposeful misspellings
  3. Add numbers or symbols between words
  4. Create a vivid mental image to aid memorization

### 3.3 Password Management
- Use a reputable password manager (e.g., LastPass, 1Password, Bitwarden)
- Generate unique passwords for each account
- Regularly update passwords (at least every 3-6 months)
- Use the password manager's security assessment features
- Enable two-factor authentication for your password manager

## 4. Cyber Hygiene

### 4.1 Software and System Updates
- Enable automatic updates for operating systems
  - Windows: Settings > Update & Security > Windows Update
  - macOS: System Preferences > Software Update
- Keep applications and browsers up-to-date
  - Enable auto-updates in application settings when possible
- Update firmware on network devices
  - Routers, smart home devices, IoT devices
- Tip: Schedule regular update checks for devices that don't support auto-updates

### 4.2 Data Backup
- Implement the 3-2-1 backup rule:
  - 3 copies of data
  - 2 different storage types (e.g., external hard drive and cloud storage)
  - 1 off-site backup (e.g., cloud storage or a physically separate location)
- Use automated backup solutions
  - Examples: Windows Backup, Time Machine (macOS), cloud services (Google Drive, Dropbox)
- Regularly test your backups to ensure data can be restored
- Encrypt sensitive backups for additional security

### 4.3 Network Security
- Use a firewall
  - Enable built-in OS firewalls (Windows Defender Firewall, macOS Firewall)
  - Consider hardware firewalls for additional protection
- Encrypt your Wi-Fi network
  - Use WPA3 encryption when available, or at least WPA2
  - Create a strong Wi-Fi password and change it periodically
- Use a VPN on public Wi-Fi
  - Choose a reputable VPN provider with a no-logs policy
  - Enable the VPN before connecting to public Wi-Fi

### 4.4 Email Security
- Be cautious with attachments and links
  - Hover over links to preview the destination URL
  - Use built-in preview features to inspect attachments before opening
- Verify sender identities
  - Check the full email address, not just the display name
  - Be wary of slight misspellings in domain names
- Use spam filters
  - Enable and configure built-in email filters
  - Consider third-party email security solutions for enhanced protection
- Encrypt sensitive emails
  - Use end-to-end encryption for confidential communications

### 4.5 Device Security
- Use screen locks and strong PINs
  - Enable biometric authentication when available (fingerprint, face recognition)
  - Use alphanumeric passcodes instead of simple 4-digit PINs
- Enable remote wipe capabilities
  - Set up Find My Device (Android) or Find My iPhone (iOS)
  - Use mobile device management (MDM) solutions for work devices
- Encrypt sensitive data
  - Use built-in encryption tools (BitLocker for Windows, FileVault for macOS)
  - Encrypt individual files or folders containing sensitive information

## 5. Monitoring and Responding to Data Breaches

### 5.1 Understanding Data Breaches
